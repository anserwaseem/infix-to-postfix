# infix-to-postfix
C++ template-based stack implementation with following features;
 * Paramterized constructor
 * getSize, which returns size of the stack.
 * isEmpty, which tells either stack is empty or not.
 * topp, which assigns the top-most value of stack to the given value.
 * push
 * pop
 
Using stack, following functions are implemented:
 * isBalanced function, which takes a string as paramter and tells either it is balanced or not (by using stack).
 * reverse function, which takes a string as a parameter and returns a reversed string (by using stack).
 * INtoPOST function, which takes a string as a parameter and uses precedence function along with stack to convert the given INFIX expression into POSTFIX espression.
